# Java functional patterns

## Description

These are a small set of functional patterns written in Java. The idea was to gather some useful abstractions 
from Scala and coded them in Java. 

It is just a proof of concept, but I think they can fit well in any Java project, especially in those that use Java 7-

## Patterns

- Either
- AtMostOnce
- Lazy
- Try
- ErrorHandler

Some implementations are very similar to Scala ones and others are conceptually adapted to Java.

## Dependencies

- Google Guava (just only `Optional`)
