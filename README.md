# Java functional patterns

## Description

These are a small set of functional patterns written in Java. The idea is to gather some useful abstractions 
from Scala and coded them into Java. 

These patterns fit well in any Java 7+ project.

## Patterns

- Either
- AtMostOnce
- Lazy
- Try
- ErrorHandler

Some implementations are very similar to Scala's and others are conceptually adapted to Java.

## Dependencies

- Google Guava (just only `Optional` and `Function`)
